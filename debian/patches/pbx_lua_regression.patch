    pbx_lua: fix regression with global sym export and context clash by pbx_config.
    
    ASTERISK-23818 (lua contexts being overwritten by contexts of the same name in
    pbx_config) surfaced because pbx_lua, having the AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
    set, was always force loaded before pbx_config.  Since I couldn't find any
    reason for pbx_lua to export it's symbols to the rest of Asterisk, I simply
    changed the flag to AST_MODFLAG_DEFAULT.  Problem solved.  What I didn't
    realize was that the symbols need to be exported not because Asterisk needs
    them but because any external Lua modules like luasql.mysql need the base
    Lua language APIs exported (ASTERISK-17279).
    
    Back to ASTERISK-23818...  It looks like there's an issue in pbx.c where
    context_merge was only merging includes, switches and ignore patterns if
    the context was already existing AND has extensions, or if the context was
    brand new.  If pbx_lua is loaded before pbx_config, the context will exist
    BUT pbx_lua, being implemented as a switch, will never place extensions in
    it, just the switch statement.  The result is that when pbx_config loads,
    it never merges the switch statement created by pbx_lua into the final
    context.
    
    This patch sets pbx_lua's modflag back to AST_MODFLAG_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS and adds
    an "else if" in context_merge that catches the case where an existing context
    has includes, switchs or ingore patterns but no actual extensions.
