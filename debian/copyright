Additional permission is granted to link Asterisk against the following
packages:

        * OpenH323
        * OpenSSL
        * Packages and modules whose authors have secured written
authorization from Linux Support Services, Inc. to be linked to Asterisk.

Asterisk modules *are* linked with Asterisk at runtime, so all Asterisk
modules also fall under the terms granted herein.

    Asterisk is distributed under GNU General Public License.  The GPL also
  must apply to all loadable modules as well, except as defined below.

    Linux Support Services, Inc. retains copyright to all of the core
  Asterisk system, and therefore can grant, at its sole discression, the
  ability for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary
  or Open Source (but non-GPL'd) modules which may be dynamically linked at
  runtime with the portions of Asterisk which fall under our copyright
  umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.  At
  this time (5/21/2001) the only component of Asterisk which is covered
  under GPL and not under our Copyright is the Xing MP3 decoder.

    If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there
  is no requirement that you provide the same exemption in your GPL'd
  products (although if you've written a module for Asterisk we would
  strongly encourage you to make the same excemption that we do).

    If you have any questions, whatsoever, regarding our licensing policy,
  please contact us.
